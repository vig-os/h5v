# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - TBD

### Added

- **Split downstream release workflow with project-owned extension hook** ([#326](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/326))
  - Add local `workflow_call` release phases (`release-core.yml`, `release-publish.yml`) and a lightweight `release.yml` orchestrator in `assets/workspace/.github/workflows/`
  - Add `release_kind` support with candidate mode (`X.Y.Z-rcN`) and final mode (`X.Y.Z`) in downstream release workflows
  - Candidate mode now auto-computes the next RC tag, skips CHANGELOG finalization/sync-issues, and publishes a GitHub pre-release
  - Add project-owned `release-extension.yml` stub and preserve it during `init-workspace.sh --force` upgrades
  - Add `validate-contract` composite action for single-source contract version validation
  - Add downstream release contract documentation and GHCR extension example in `docs/DOWNSTREAM_RELEASE.md`
- **`jq` in devcontainer image** ([#425](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/425))
  - Install the `jq` CLI in the GHCR image so containerized workflows (e.g. `release-core` validate / downstream Release Core) can pipe JSON through `jq`

- **Smoke-test dispatch payload now carries source run traceability metadata** ([#289](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/289))
  - Candidate release dispatches now include source repo/workflow/run/SHA metadata plus a deterministic `correlation_id`
  - Smoke-test dispatch receiver logs normalized source context, derives source run URL when possible, and writes it to workflow summary output
  - Release-cycle docs now define required vs optional dispatch payload keys and the future callback contract path for `publish-candidate`
- **Smoke-test repository dispatch now runs for final releases too** ([#173](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/173))
  - `release.yml` now triggers the existing smoke-test dispatch contract for both `candidate` and `final` release kinds
  - Final release summaries and release-cycle documentation now reflect dispatch behavior for both release modes
- **Workspace CI templates now use a single container-based workflow** ([#327](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/327))
  - Consolidate `assets/workspace/.github/workflows/ci.yml` as the canonical CI workflow and remove the obsolete `ci-container.yml` template
  - Extract reusable `assets/workspace/.github/actions/resolve-image` and run workspace release tests in the same containerized workflow model
  - Update smoke-test and release-cycle documentation to reference the single CI workflow contract
- **Final release now requires downstream RC pre-release gate** ([#331](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/331))
  - Add upstream final-release validation that requires a downstream GitHub pre-release for the latest published RC tag
  - Move smoke-test dispatch to a dedicated release job and include `release_kind` in the dispatch payload
  - Add downstream `repository-dispatch.yml` template that runs smoke tests and creates pre-release/final release artifacts
- **Ship changelog into workspace payload and smoke-test deploy root** ([#333](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/333))
  - Sync canonical `CHANGELOG.md` into both workspace root and `.devcontainer/` template paths
  - Smoke-test dispatch now copies `.devcontainer/CHANGELOG.md` to repository root so deploy output keeps a root changelog
- **Final release now publishes a GitHub Release with finalized notes** ([#310](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/310))
  - Add a final-only publish step in `.github/workflows/release.yml` that creates a GitHub Release for `X.Y.Z`
  - Source GitHub Release notes from the finalized `CHANGELOG.md` section and fail the run if notes extraction or release publishing fails
- **Release dispatch and publish ordering hardened for 0.3.1** ([#336](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/336))
  - Make smoke-test dispatch fire-and-forget in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and decouple rollback from downstream completion timing
  - Add bounded retries to the final-release downstream RC pre-release gate API check
  - Move final GitHub Release creation to the end of publish so artifact publication/signing completes before release object creation
  - Add concurrency control to `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` to prevent overlapping dispatch races
  - Handle smoke-test dispatch failures with a targeted issue while avoiding destructive rollback after publish artifacts are already released
- **Redesigned smoke-test dispatch release orchestration** ([#358](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/358))
  - Replace premature `publish-release` behavior with full downstream orchestration: deploy-to-dev merge gate, `prepare-release.yml`, release PR readiness/approval, and `release.yml` dispatch polling
  - Add upstream failure issue reporting with job-phase results and cleanup guidance when dispatch orchestration fails
- **Smoke-test release orchestration now runs as two phases** ([#402](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/402))
  - Keep `repository-dispatch.yml` focused on deploy/prepare/release-PR readiness and move release dispatch to a dedicated merged-PR workflow (`on-release-pr-merge.yml`)
  - Add release-kind labeling and auto-merge enablement for release PRs, and keep upstream failure notifications in both phases
  - Remove release-branch upstream `CHANGELOG.md` sync from `repository-dispatch.yml` (previously added in [#358](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/358))
- **Dependabot dependency update batch** ([#414](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/pull/414))
  - Bump `github/codeql-action` from `4.32.6` to `4.34.1` and `anchore/sbom-action` from `0.23.1` to `0.24.0`

  - Bump `@devcontainers/cli` from `0.84.0` to `0.84.1`
- **cursor-agent install is now resilient to CDN failures** ([#434](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/434))
  - Retries 3 times with backoff before giving up
  - Build succeeds without cursor-agent when Cursor's CDN is unavailable
- **Immutable GitHub releases, tag rulesets, and forward-fix policy** ([#446](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/446))
  - Final releases create a **draft** GitHub Release for human review before publishing; rollback no longer deletes remote tags
  - Release workflows skip redundant tag push when the tag already matches the finalized commit; workspace `release-core` / `release-publish` and smoke-test failure guidance updated accordingly
  - Document tag rulesets, immutable releases, and recovery in `docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md`, `docs/DOWNSTREAM_RELEASE.md`, and `docs/CROSS_REPO_RELEASE_GATE.md`
- **Container image tests expect current GitHub CLI minor line**
  - Update `tests/test_image.py` `EXPECTED_VERSIONS["gh"]` to `2.89.` to match the CLI shipped in the image

### Removed

- **PR Title Check GitHub Actions workflow** ([#444](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/444))
  - Remove `.github/workflows/pr-title-check.yml`; commit message rules remain enforced via local hooks and `validate-commit-msg`
  - Remove `--subject-only` from `validate-commit-msg` (it existed only for PR title CI)

### Fixed

- **Smoke-test deploy restores workspace CHANGELOG for prepare-release** ([#417](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/417))
  - Add `prepare-changelog unprepare` to rename the top `## [semver] - …` heading to `## Unreleased`
  - `init-workspace.sh --smoke-test` copies `.devcontainer/CHANGELOG.md` into workspace `CHANGELOG.md` and runs unprepare; remove duplicate remap from smoke-test dispatch workflow
- **Release app permission docs now include downstream workflow dispatch requirements** ([#397](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/397))
  - Update `docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md` to require `Actions` read/write for `RELEASE_APP` on the validation repository
  - Clarify this is required so downstream `repository-dispatch.yml` can trigger release orchestration workflows via `workflow_dispatch`
- **Smoke-test dispatch no longer fails on release PR self-approval** ([#402](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/402))
  - Remove bot self-approval from `repository-dispatch.yml` and replace with release-kind labeling plus auto-merge enablement
  - Remove in-job polling for release PR merge and downstream release execution from phase 1 orchestration
  - Phase 2 (`on-release-pr-merge.yml`) fails validation unless the merged release PR has `release-kind:final` or `release-kind:candidate`
- **Sync-main-to-dev PRs now trigger CI reliably in downstream repos** ([#398](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/398))
  - Replace API-based sync branch creation with `git push` in `assets/workspace/.github/workflows/sync-main-to-dev.yml`
- **Sync-main-to-dev no longer dispatches CI via workflow_dispatch** ([#405](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/405))
  - `workflow_dispatch` runs are omitted from the PR status check rollup, so they do not satisfy branch protection on the sync PR
  - Remove the post-PR `gh workflow run ci.yml` step and drop `actions: write` from the sync job in `.github/workflows/sync-main-to-dev.yml` and `assets/workspace/.github/workflows/sync-main-to-dev.yml`
- **Sync-main-to-dev conflict detection uses merge-tree** ([#410](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/410))
  - Replace working-tree trial merge with `git merge-tree --write-tree` so clean merges are not mislabeled as conflicts
  - Enable auto-merge when dev merges cleanly with main; print merge-tree output on conflicts; fail the step on unexpected errors
- **Smoke-test release phase 2 branch-not-found failure** ([#419](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/419))
  - Merge phase 2 (`on-release-pr-merge.yml`) back into `repository-dispatch.yml` so the release runs while `release/<version>` still exists, matching the normal release flow
  - Remove `on-release-pr-merge.yml` from the smoke-test template
- **Pinned commit-action to v0.2.0** ([#354](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/354))
  - Updated workflow pins from `vig-os/commit-action@c0024cb` (v0.1.5) to `1bc004353d08d9332a0cb54920b148256220c8e0` (v0.2.0) in release, sync-issues, prepare-release, and smoke-test workflows
  - Upstream v0.2.0 adds bounded retry with exponential backoff for transient GitHub API failures (configurable `MAX_ATTEMPTS` and delay bounds)
  - Efficient multi-file commits via `createTree` inline content for text files, binary blobs only when needed, and chunked tree creation for large change sets
  - Exports `isBinaryFile`, `getFileMode`, and `TREE_ENTRY_CHUNK_SIZE` for library use; sequential binary blob creation to reduce secondary rate-limit bursts

- **Release finalization now commits generated docs and refreshes PR content** ([#300](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/300))
  - Final release automation regenerates docs before committing so pre-commit `generate-docs` does not fail CI with tracked file diffs
  - Release PR body is refreshed from finalized `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Release attestation warnings reduced by granting artifact metadata permission** ([#348](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/348))
  - Add `artifact-metadata: write` to the release publish job so attestation steps can persist metadata storage records
  - Keep `actions/attest`-based SBOM attestation path and remove missing-permission warnings from publish runs
- **Smoke-test dispatch deploy now repairs workspace ownership before changelog copy** ([#352](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/352))
  - Add a write probe and conditional `sudo chown -R` in `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` after installer execution
  - Prevent `Permission denied` failures when copying `.devcontainer/CHANGELOG.md` to repository root in GitHub-hosted runner jobs
- **Smoke-test release lookup no longer treats missing tags as existing releases** ([#355](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/355))
  - Change `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` to branch on `gh api` exit status when querying `releases/tags/<tag>`
  - Ensure missing release tags follow the create path instead of failing with `prerelease=null` mismatch
- **Bounded retry added for network-dependent setup and prepare-release calls** ([#357](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/357))
  - Replace shell-based retry helper with pure Python `retry` CLI in `vig-utils` (`packages/vig-utils/src/vig_utils/retry.py`)
  - Update this repository CI workflows to call `uv run retry` after `setup-env` dependency sync
  - Update downstream workflow templates to call `retry` directly in devcontainer jobs and remove `source` lines
  - Ensure downstream containerized jobs resolve image tags from `.vig-os` instead of hardcoded `latest`
  - Bundle idempotency guards for branch/PR/tag/release creation paths to keep retried network calls safe on reruns
  - Remove synced `retry.sh` artifacts and BATS retry tests in favor of `vig-utils` pytest coverage
- **Release workflow no longer fails when retry tooling is unavailable** ([#365](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/365))
  - Extend `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yml` with a reusable `retry` shell function exported via `BASH_ENV` as the retry single source of truth
  - Add `setup-env` input support for uv-only usage by allowing Python setup to be disabled when jobs only need retry tooling
  - Switch release workflow retry calls from `uv run retry` to shared `retry` and remove duplicated inline retry implementations
- **Upstream sync workflows no longer depend on pre-published GHCR image tags** ([#367](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/367))
  - Remove upstream `.vig-os` files at repository root and `assets/smoke-test/` to eliminate downstream-only configuration from upstream CI
  - Refactor `.github/workflows/sync-issues.yml` and `.github/workflows/sync-main-to-dev.yml` to run natively on runners via `./.github/actions/setup-env` instead of `resolve-image` + `container`
- **Release test-image setup now recovers from uv sync crashes** ([#370](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/370))
  - Harden `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yml` to retry `uv sync --frozen --all-extras` once after clearing uv cache and removing stale `.venv`
  - Prevent repeat release test failures when `setup-env` is executed multiple times in the same job
- **Release setup-env no longer self-sources retry helper via BASH_ENV** ([#374](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/374))
  - Guard the retry-helper merge logic in `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yml` to skip merging when `PREV_BASH_ENV` already equals `RETRY_HELPER`
  - Prevent infinite `source` recursion and exit 139 crashes when `setup-env` is invoked multiple times in one job
- **Smoke-test dispatch now checks out repository before local setup action** ([#376](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/376))
  - Add `actions/checkout` to the `smoke-test` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` before invoking `./.github/actions/setup-env`
  - Prevent dispatch failures caused by missing local action metadata (`action.yml`) in a fresh job workspace
- **Workspace resolve-image jobs now checkout local action metadata** ([#380](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/380))
  - Update `sparse-checkout` in workspace `resolve-image` jobs to include `.github/actions/resolve-image` in addition to `.vig-os`
  - Prevent CI failures in downstream deploy PRs where local composite actions were missing from sparse checkout
- **Smoke-test dispatch gh jobs now set explicit repo context** ([#386](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/386))
  - Add job-level `GH_REPO: ${{ github.repository }}` to `cleanup-release`, `trigger-prepare-release`, `ready-release-pr`, and `trigger-release` in `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml`
  - Prevent `gh` CLI failures (`fatal: not a git repository`) in runner jobs that do not perform `actions/checkout`
- **Smoke-test release orchestration now validates workflow contract before dispatch** ([#389](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/389))
  - Add a preflight check that verifies `prepare-release.yml` and `release.yml` are resolvable on dispatch ref `dev` before downstream orchestration starts
  - Dispatch and polling now use explicit ref/branch context (`--ref dev` / `--branch dev`) to avoid default-branch workflow registry drift and `404 workflow not found` failures
- **Smoke-test preflight now uses gh CLI ref-compatible workflow validation** ([#392](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/392))
  - Update `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` preflight checks to call `gh workflow view` with `--yaml` when `--ref` is set
  - Prevent false preflight failures caused by newer GitHub CLI argument validation before `prepare-release` dispatch
- **Downstream release workflow templates hardened for smoke-test orchestration** ([#394](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/394))
  - Add missing `git config --global --add safe.directory "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"` in containerized release and sync jobs that run git after checkout
  - Decouple `release.yml` rollback container startup from `needs.core.outputs.image_tag` by resolving the image in a dedicated `resolve-image` job
  - Add explicit release caller/reusable workflow permissions for `actions` and `pull-requests` operations, and update dispatch header comments to reference only current CI workflows
- **Workspace containerized workflows now pin bash for run steps** ([#395](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/395))
  - Set `defaults.run.shell: bash` in containerized workspace release and prepare jobs so `set -euo pipefail` scripts do not execute under POSIX `sh`
  - Prevent downstream smoke-test failures caused by `set: Illegal option -o pipefail` in container jobs
- **Downstream release templates now require explicit app tokens for write paths** ([#400](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/400))
  - Update `assets/workspace/.github/workflows/prepare-release.yml`, `release-core.yml`, `release-publish.yml`, `release.yml`, and `sync-issues.yml` to remove `github.token` fallback from protected write operations
  - Route protected branch/ref writes through Commit App tokens and release orchestration/issue operations through Release App tokens
  - Document downstream token requirements in `docs/DOWNSTREAM_RELEASE.md` and `docs/CROSS_REPO_RELEASE_GATE.md`
  - Use `github.token` specifically for Actions cache deletion in `sync-issues.yml` because that API path requires explicit `actions: write` job token scope
  - Use Commit App credentials for rollback checkout in `release.yml` so rollback branch/tag writes can still bypass protected refs
- **setup-env retries uv install on transient GitHub Releases download failures** ([#407](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/407))
  - Add `continue-on-error` plus a delayed second attempt for `astral-sh/setup-uv` in `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yml`
  - Reduce flaky release publish failures when GitHub CDN returns transient HTTP errors for uv release assets
- **Smoke-test deploy keeps workspace scaffold as root CHANGELOG** ([#403](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/403))
  - Stop overwriting `CHANGELOG.md` with a minimal stub in `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml`
  - Require the workspace `CHANGELOG.md` from `init-workspace` so downstream `prepare-release` validation matches shipped layout
  - When the first changelog section is `## [X.Y.Z] - …` (TBD or a release date), remap that top version header to `## Unreleased` so downstream `prepare-release` can run
- **Smoke-test dispatch release validate no longer runs docker inside devcontainer** ([#421](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/421))
  - Remove redundant `docker manifest inspect` step from `release-core.yml` validate job (container image is already proof of accessibility; `resolve-image` validates on the runner)
  - Set `GH_REPO` for rollback `gh issue create` in workspace `release.yml` when git checkout is skipped
- **Container image tests expect current uv minor line** ([#423](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/423))
  - Update `tests/test_image.py` `EXPECTED_VERSIONS["uv"]` to match uv 0.11.x from the latest release install path in the image build
- **Container image tests expect current just minor line** ([#423](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/423))
  - Update `tests/test_image.py` `EXPECTED_VERSIONS["just"]` to match just 1.48.x from the latest release install path in the image build
- **Smoke-test dispatch approves release PR before downstream release** ([#430](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/430))
  - Grant `pull-requests: write` on `ready-release-pr` and approve with `github.token` (`github-actions[bot]`)
  - Satisfy `release-core.yml` approval gate without the release app self-approving its own PR
- **commit-action retries enabled for transient git ref API failures** ([#436](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/436))
  - Set `MAX_ATTEMPTS: "3"` on every `vig-os/commit-action` step so v0.2.0 bounded retry actually runs (default was 1)
  - Covers smoke-test deploy, prepare-release, release finalization, sync-issues, and workspace templates
- **Release validation fails when bot approves PR** ([#438](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/438))
  - Add fallback to individual PR review check when `reviewDecision` is empty (bot approvals not counted by branch protection)
- **Downstream candidate RC tag can match upstream dispatch** ([#441](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/441))
  - Workspace `release.yml` / `release-core.yml` accept optional `rc-number` so candidate tags are not always recomputed from local tags only
  - Smoke-test `repository-dispatch.yml` exposes `base_version` and `rc_number` job outputs for orchestration that calls workspace `release.yml`
- **Release validate fails early when GitHub Release already exists** ([#443](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/443))
  - Validate job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` queries `GET /repos/.../releases/tags/<PUBLISH_VERSION>` with retries and classifies errors like the downstream RC gate; only a documented not-found response is treated as “no release,” and ambiguous API failures fail closed before build/sign/publish
  - Publish job uses the same existence checks before and after `gh release create` instead of `gh release view` with discarded stderr
- **Release tag resolution and GitHub Release view retries** ([#446](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/446))
  - Fall back to plain `refs/tags/<tag>` when the peeled ref is empty (lightweight remote tags) in `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `release-core.yml`, and `release-publish.yml`
  - Use one retried `gh release view` in workspace `release-publish.yml` so draft/prerelease skip paths parse JSON from the same successful response
- **Workspace release publish `tag_already_exists` input coercion** ([#451](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/451))
  - Pass a boolean into `release-publish.yml` via `needs.core.outputs.tag_already_exists == 'true'` so `workflow_call` does not reject string `"true"`/`"false"` job outputs

### Security

- **Smoke-test dispatch workflow permissions now follow least privilege** ([#340](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/340))
  - Reduce `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` workflow token permissions from write to read by default
  - Grant `contents: write` only to `publish-release`, the single job that creates or edits GitHub Releases

  - New rule `.cursor/rules/subagent-delegation.mdc` documenting when and how to delegate mechanical sub-steps to lightweight subagents via the Task tool
  - Added `## Delegation` sections to 12 skills identifying steps that should spawn lightweight/standard-tier subagents to reduce token consumption on the primary autonomous model

### Changed

- **Release CHANGELOG flow redesigned** ([#172](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/172))
  - `prepare-release.yml` now freezes CHANGELOG on dev (Unreleased → [X.Y.Z] - TBD + fresh empty Unreleased), then forks release branch and strips the empty Unreleased section
  - Dev never enters a state without `## Unreleased`; both branches share the [X.Y.Z] section for clean merges
  - Candidate releases skip CHANGELOG changes; only final releases set the date
  - No CHANGELOG reset needed during post-release sync
- **Release automation now uses dedicated GitHub App identities** ([#172](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/172))
  - Replaced deprecated `APP_SYNC_ISSUES_*` secrets with `RELEASE_APP_*` for release and preparation workflows
  - `sync-issues.yml` now uses `COMMIT_APP_*`; `sync-main-to-dev.yml` uses both apps (commit app for refs, release app for PR operations)
  - Removed automatic `sync-issues` trigger from `sync-main-to-dev.yml` and documented the app permission model in `docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md`
- **Container CI defaults image tag from `.vig-os`** ([#264](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/264))
  - `ci.yml` and `ci-container.yml` now run only on `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` after removing unused `workflow_call` triggers
  - `ci-container.yml` now resolves `DEVCONTAINER_VERSION` from `.vig-os` before container jobs start
  - Manual `workflow_dispatch` runs can still override the image via `image-tag`; fallback remains `latest` when no version is available
  - Added an early manifest check in `resolve-image` so workflows fail fast if the resolved image tag is unavailable or inaccessible

- **worktree-clean: add filter mode for stopped-only vs all** ([#158](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/158))
  - Default `just worktree-clean` (no args) now cleans only stopped worktrees, skips running tmux sessions
  - `just worktree-clean all` retains previous behavior (clean all worktrees) with warning
  - Summary output shows cleaned vs skipped worktrees
  - `just wt-clean` alias unchanged
- **Consolidate sync_manifest.py and utils.py into manifest-as-config architecture** ([#89](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/89))

  - `just sync-workspace` and prepare-build keep workspace template in sync
- **Autonomous PR skills use pull request template** ([#147](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/147))
  - `pr_create` and `worktree_pr` now read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and fill each section from available context

  - Ensures autonomous PRs match manual PR structure and include all checklist items
- **Rename skill namespace separator from colon to underscore** ([#128](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/128))
  - All skill directories under `.cursor/skills/` and `assets/workspace/.cursor/skills/` renamed (e.g. `issue:create` → `issue_create`)
  - All internal cross-references, frontmatter, prose, `CLAUDE.md` command table, and label taxonomy updated
  - `issue_create` skill enhanced: gathers context via `just gh-issues` before drafting, suggests parent/child relationships and milestones
  - `issue_create` skill now includes TDD acceptance criterion for testable issue types
  - Remaining `sync-issues` workflow trigger references removed from skills
  - `tdd.mdc` expanded with test scenario checklist and test type guidance; switched from always-on to glob-triggered on source/test files
  - `code_tdd`, `code_execute`, and `worktree_execute` skills now reference `tdd.mdc` explicitly

  - Move breaking change from type to a separate modifier checkbox
  - Add release-branch hint to Related Issues section
- **Updated update notification message** ([#73](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/73))

  - Single source of truth for which files to sync and what transformations to apply
  - `prepare-build.sh` and `just sync-workspace` both call the same manifest
- **Namespace-prefixed Cursor skill names** ([#67](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/67))
  - Renamed all 15 skills with colon-separated namespace prefixes (`issue:`, `design:`, `code:`, `git:`, `ci:`, `pr:`)
  - Enables filtering by namespace when invoking skills (e.g., typing `code:` shows implementation skills)

### Removed

- **`post-release.yml`** — replaced by `sync-main-to-dev.yml` ([#172](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/172))
- **`scripts/prepare-build.sh`** — merged into `build.sh` ([#48](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/48))
- **`scripts/sync-prs-issues.sh`** — deprecated sync script ([#48](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/48))

  - Removed `scripts/utils.py` shim — superseded by `vig_utils.utils`

### Fixed

- **`just` default recipe hidden by lint recipe** ([#254](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/254))
  - The `default` recipe must appear before any other recipe in the justfile; `lint` was placed first, shadowing the recipe listing
  - Moved `default` recipe above `lint` to restore `just` with no arguments showing available recipes
- **Broken `gh-issues --help` guard in justfile recipe** ([#173](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/173))
  - `gh-issues` CLI has no `--help` flag, so the availability check always failed even when the binary was installed
  - Removed the broken guard; binary availability is now verified by the image test suite
- **Smoke-test redeploy preserves synced docs directories** ([#262](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/262))
  - `init-workspace.sh --smoke-test` now excludes `docs/issues/` and `docs/pull-requests/` from `rsync --delete`
  - Re-deploying smoke assets no longer removes docs synced by `sync-issues`
- **Prepare-release uses scoped app tokens for protected branch writes** ([#268](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/268))
  - `prepare-release.yml` now uses `COMMIT_APP_*` for git/ref and `commit-action` operations that touch `dev` and release refs
  - Draft PR creation in prepare-release now uses `RELEASE_APP_*` token scope for pull-request operations
- **generate-docs picks up unreleased TBD version on release branches** ([#271](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/271))
  - `get_version_from_changelog()` and `get_release_date_from_changelog()` now skip entries without a concrete release date
- **PR fingerprint check false positives on plain-text AI tool mentions** ([#274](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/274))
  - `contains_agent_fingerprint` now restricts name matching to attribution-context lines (e.g. "generated by", "authored by") instead of scanning the entire content
  - Wire up `allow_patterns` from `agent-blocklist.toml` to strip known-safe text (dotfile paths, doc filenames) before checking
- **Release candidate publish retags loaded images before push** ([#281](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/281))
  - `release.yml` now tags `ghcr.io/vig-os/devcontainer:X.Y.Z-arch` artifacts as `X.Y.Z-rcN-arch` before `docker push` in candidate runs
  - Prevents publish failures caused by pushing candidate tags that were never created locally after `docker load`
- **Pinned commit-action to the malformed path fix release** ([#286](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/286))
  - Updated smoke-test and release-related workflows to `vig-os/commit-action@c0024cbad0e501764127cccab732c6cd465b4646` (`v0.1.5`)
  - Resolves failures when commit-action receives `FILE_PATHS: .` and accidentally includes invalid `.git/*` tree paths
- **Smoke-test deploy commit no longer references non-local issue IDs** ([#284](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/284))
  - `assets/smoke-test/.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml` no longer injects `Refs: #258` into automated `chore: deploy <tag>` commits in the smoke-test repository
  - Added maintainer note that workflow-template changes require manual redeploy to `vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test` and promotion through PRs to `main`
- **Install name sanitization trims invalid package boundaries** ([#291](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/291))
  - `install.sh` now normalizes sanitized project names to ensure they start/end with alphanumeric characters before passing `SHORT_NAME`
  - `init-workspace.sh` mirrors the same normalization so generated `pyproject.toml` names cannot end with separators like `_`

### Security

- **Temporary Trivy exception for CVE-2025-15558 in gh binary** ([#122](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/issues/122))
  - Added `CVE-2025-15558` to `.trivyignore` with risk assessment, upstream dependency context, and an expiration date
  - Keeps CI vulnerability scan unblocked while waiting for an upstream `gh` release that includes the patched `github.com/docker/cli` dependency

- `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable for instant venv access without rebuild
- `pip-licenses` pre-commit hook for dependency license compliance checking (blocks GPL-3.0/AGPL-3.0)
- Pre-flight container cleanup check in test suite with helpful error messages
- `just clean-test-containers` recipe for removing lingering test containers
- `PYTEST_AUTO_CLEANUP` environment variable for automatic test container cleanup
- `docker-compose.project.yaml` for team-shared configuration (git-tracked, preserved during upgrades)
- `docker-compose.local.yaml` for personal configuration (git-ignored, preserved during upgrades)
- Build-time manifest generation for optimized placeholder replacement
- `tests/CLEANUP.md` documentation for test container management

### Changed

- `ORG_NAME` now defaults to `"vigOS/devc"` instead of requiring user input
- `init-workspace.sh` now escapes special characters in placeholder values (fixes sed errors with `/` in ORG_NAME)
- Documentation updated with curl-based install as primary quick start method
- **BREAKING**: Replaced `make` with `just` - all build commands now use `just` (e.g., `just test`, `just build`, `just push`)
- **Versioning scheme**: Switched from X.Y format to Semantic Versioning (X.Y.Z format).
All new releases use MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format (e.g., 0.2.0).
The previous v0.1 release is kept as-is for backwards compatibility.
- **Package versions**: Bumped tool and project versions from previous release:
  - `uv` (0.9.17 → 0.9.21)
  - `gh` (2.83.1 → 2.83.2)
  - `pre-commit` (4.5.0 → 4.5.1)
  - `ruff` (0.14.8 → 0.14.10)
- VS Code Python interpreter now points to pre-built venv (`/root/assets/workspace/.venv`)
- Test container cleanup check runs once at start of `just test` instead of each test phase
- **BREAKING**: Docker Compose file hierarchy now uses `project.yaml` and `local.yaml` instead of `override.yml`
- Socket detection prioritizes Podman over Docker Desktop on macOS and Linux
- `{{TAG}}` placeholder replacement moved to container with build-time manifest generation (significantly faster initialization)
- Socket mount configuration uses environment variable with fallback: `${CONTAINER_SOCKET_PATH:-/var/run/docker.sock}`
- `initialize.sh` writes socket path to `.env` file instead of modifying YAML directly
- `init-workspace.sh` simplified: removed cross-platform `sed` handling (always runs in Linux)

### Removed

- Deprecated `version` field from all Docker Compose files
- `:Z` SELinux flag from socket mounts (incompatible with macOS socket files)
- `docker-compose.override.yml` (replaced by `project.yaml` and `local.yaml`)
- `docker-compose.sidecar.yaml` (merged into main `docker-compose.yml`)

### Fixed

- Test failures from lingering containers between test phases
(now detected and reported before test run; added `PYTEST_SKIP_CONTAINER_CHECK` environment variable)
- Improved error messages for devcontainer startup failures
- SSH commit signing: Changed `user.signingkey` from file path to email identifier to support SSH agent forwarding.
  Git now uses the SSH agent for signing by looking up the email in allowed-signers and matching with the agent key.
- Fixed `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` path to use container path instead of host path after copying git configuration.
- Automatically add git user email to allowed-signers file during setup to ensure commits can be signed and verified.
- macOS Podman socket mounting errors caused by SELinux `:Z` flag on socket files
- Socket detection during tests now matches runtime behavior (Podman-first)

## [0.1](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer/releases/tag/0.1) - 2025-12-10
